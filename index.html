        <heading>Jesus Walks on the Water</heading>
        <p>
          <v><n>22</n>
            Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. </v>
          <v><n>23</n>
            After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, </v>
          <v><n>24</n>
            and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. </v>
        </p>
        <p>
          <v><n>25</n>
            Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. </v>
          <v><n>26</n>
            When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost,&rdquo; they said, and cried out in fear. </v>
          <v><n>27</n>
            But Jesus immediately said to them: <jesus>&ldquo;Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.&rdquo;</jesus> </v>
            <br>
          <v><n>28</n>
            &ldquo;Lord, if it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;tell me to come to you on the water.&rdquo; </v>
            <br>
          <v><n>29</n>
            <jesus>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; </jesus> he said.
            <br>
            Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. </v>

            <v><n>30</n>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save me!&rdquo;</v>
        </p>
        <p>
          <v><n>31</n>
            Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. <jesus>&ldquo;You of little faith,&rdquo;</jesus> he said, <jesus>&ldquo;why did you doubt?&rdquo;</jesus> </v>
          <v><n>33</n>
            And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. </v>
          <v><n>34</n>Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God.&rdquo;</v>

        <!-- <heading>The Widow's Offering</heading> -->
        <p>
          <v><n>1</n>
            Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, </v>
          <v><n>2</n>
            and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. </v>
          <v><n>3</n>
            And he said, <jesus>&ldquo;Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them.</jesus> </v>
          <v><n>3</n>
            <jesus>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.&rdquo;</jesus> </v>

        <p>
          <v><n>61</n>
            And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, <jesus>&ldquo;Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</jesus> </v>
          <v><n>62</n>
             And he went out and wept bitterly. </v>

            Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him. </v>
          <v><n>64</n>
            They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, &ldquo;Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?&rdquo; </v>

            In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </v>
          <v><n>2</n>
            He was with God in the beginning. </v>
          <v><n>3</n>
            Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</v>
